Assignment 3: Split the Bill
========================================

You and your friends went out to eat. The bill was quite high and you want to split it evenly.

Write a Python program that:
- Accepts the total bill amount.
- Accepts the number of friends.
- Displays how much each person should pay.

Example:
Total bill = 1250
Friends = 5
Each should pay = 250.0
'''
Bill = int(input("enter the amount :"))
Friends = int(input("enter no of people :"))
print(f" Each should pay = {Bill/Friends} ")
